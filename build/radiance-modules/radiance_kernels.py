"""radiance (gfx1201 / RDNA4) custom kernel dispatcher: the single place that picks which kernels vLLM
launches for block-FP8 GEMM, plus the preshuffle-GEMM and tuned unified-attention config hooks. vLLM's
source hooks (installed by patch_radiance_dispatch.py) only delegate here, so routing changes live in
this file instead of a vLLM patch.

The dispatch fns run inside vLLM's torch.compiled region, so they must be dynamo-traceable: plain shape
branches dispatching to registered torch.ops.*, no lru_cache / hasattr / side effects in the hot path.

#     limited: the optimum sits at 8 query rows per warp (BLOCK_M/num_warps), and the same 8 is
#     reached either by halving BLOCK_M or doubling num_warps (64/8 measured -27%). Raising TILE_SIZE
